In our daily journey through the city, we consciously or subconsciously store sensations as audio-visual memories. What if we were given the possibilities to store these experiences and revisit them anytime desired? What if we were able to experience other citizens’ stored data? If these experiences were re-interpreted as immersive data patterns, would our understanding of architectural and urban morphology, materiality, and microclimatology become more elevated?
